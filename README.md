## Project Description

Welcome to `my-nextjs-journey`! This is a repository where I will be documenting my learning journey as I explore building web applications with Next.js.

Throughout my journey, I will be conducting many experiments and encountering various errors along the way. In this repo, I will be documenting my progress, including notes on what I have learned, challenges I have faced, and how I overcame them.

This repository serves not only as a personal learning tool but also as a resource for anyone who may be interested in learning about Next.js. Feel free to follow along with my journey, suggest improvements or even collaborate with me!

Thanks for visiting and happy coding!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
